# Ajax

- This rebo is feching two APIs from 'unsblash' an 'nytimes' and return one photo from unsblash and some articles from nyt based on user search.
- The app is making asynchronous requests using three different methods:
  - the XHR object
  - jQuery's `.ajax()` method
  - the Fetch API
- The starting code and structure is from [Udacity's Ajax course]()

The same project is built with each of these techniques. You'll find one folder for each.

**Note:** i'm just adding a copy of one of the HTML files in the root for the sake of deploying the page on github.
